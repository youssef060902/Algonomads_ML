    "### Problem statement\n",
    "Breast cancer is one of the most common spread and Dangerous cancers worldwide . and the process of manual diagnosis and waiting for the Professional to analyze, while its not 100% effective , can be time consuming and subject to human error . thats why there is an essential need to help the medical Equipment by providing accurate and reliable decision support that assist and help classify the tumors detected as benign or malignant.\n",
    "To address this need,machine Learning has been applied to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset for breast cancer classification. specifically , the recent case study by Department of Computer Science Adamson University Manila, Philippines where researchers used GRU-SVM, Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and others. by measuring and acheiving an acuracy test we can tell that they achieved excelent results in telling benign and malignant tumors apart . and as we know this technology isnt to work alone . its designed as smart assistant for professionals to make their work faster. the main users are : pathologists , oncologists , gynaecologist\n",

    "Ilef find that she has a mass in her breast so she decided to check with an oncologist, he asked her to do an fna test ,after the result he presented to her te new ai system 'ena healthy ' analysed her test and find out if it's a benign or malignant tumor,ilef panicked, she was afraid of  having a malignant tumor but the doctor calmed her and informed her that it is only an early warning because the system could also tell him the stage of tumor ,and means that they have to extract the mass by a surgery and then they will analyse it. So she booked an appointment with a surgent oncologist. Then a pathologists analyses the mass and 'ena healthy' told them if there is a risk in the future or not. After that she goes to gynaecologist to do frequent check ups to know the risk in the future.  \n",
